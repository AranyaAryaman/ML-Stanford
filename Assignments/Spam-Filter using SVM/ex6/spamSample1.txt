Dear ,
 
Learning never stops and we need to continue to empower our children by imparting knowledge and information so that we can help them in taking the right decisions.
We are starting a series of webinars that will be conducted over Zoom. The first one will focus on helping high school students craft a roadmap to get into a medical college in the UK.
Join us at 5 pm (GST) on Wednesday, March 25th to make the best of your quarantine.
We will be conducting many more sessions on MBA admissions, College admissions process in the US/UK/Canada/UAE, how to choose a curriculum and many more.
